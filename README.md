# perfect-gaussian

Inspired by Ed Pegg Jr's [Neglected Gaussian Integers](http://www.mathpuzzle.com/Gaussians.html) page, perfect-gaussian is a Java math library with goals of discovering:
* a perfect Gaussian integer
* amicable Gaussian integers
* a Gaussian aliquot cycle

Some free Amazon Servers have been set up (t2.micro, Windows Server 2012 R2) and are running through various set of the numbers. Assuming that the code is correct, the current progress is in the table below. (a range of 800 to 899 means every number a + bi has been tested where a is in the range {800 ... 899} and b is in the range {0 ... 899}; and every number a + bi has been tested where a is in the range {0 ... 899} and b is in the range {800 ... 899}). When the free 750 monthly hours for Windows servers has been used, Linux servers will be used.
